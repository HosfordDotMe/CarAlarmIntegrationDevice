# Car Alarm Integration Device

This project's goal is to add more outputs and better control to automotive car alarms and remote 
start systems. This functionality is expected to be added to an alarm via w2w for legacy systems 
and through data using iDatalink, DBI, and/or D2D connections.

## Hardware

Hardware for this device is currently in the design phase and will be added to the repo as work progresses.
